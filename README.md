# DoS Attack Simulations: Slowloris & HTTP Flood

This repository contains code and documentation for simulating and mitigating the effects of two common types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks:

- **Slowloris attack**
- **HTTP Flood / Amplification attack**

These simulations were developed as part of a **university-level cybersecurity project** to better understand how DoS attacks operate and how systems can be configured to defend against them. The focus is on educational value, ethical cybersecurity training, and academic research.

## Project Goals

- Implement simplified versions of Slowloris and HTTP Flood attacks in a controlled environment.
- Analyze the impact of these attacks on lightweight HTTP servers.
- Explore and apply mitigation techniques (e.g., connection throttling, timeouts, firewall rules).
- Document the behavior and effectiveness of different defenses.
